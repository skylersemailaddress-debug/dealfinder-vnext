# DealFinder vNext — AI Handoff

I do not read code. Work like a senior engineer.

Rules:
1) Summarize your understanding in plain English before changes.
2) Keep changes small and safe; no rewrites unless necessary.
3) Write a CHANGELOG entry for each change: What / Why / Risk.
4) Create/update ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md in plain English.
5) If a change could affect pricing logic or data output format, ask first.

Goal:
- Make the app reliably produce the intended outputs and pass acceptance tests.
